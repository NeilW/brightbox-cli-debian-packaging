== Packaging

=== Vendoring libraries

gems can be vendored into `lib/brightbox-cli/vendor/` for packaging
and will be prioritised over any gems.

We've customized some gems and they're permanently vendored (i.e: in
the git tree).

=== Debian/Ubuntu packaging

Any gems that have equivalent packages available are set as
dependencies to the Debian package.  Any other gems are vendored prior
to packaging.  These are:

* formatador (required by hirb)
* excon (required by fog)
* gli
* fog
* hirb
* ini
* multi_json

Rubygems support can be disabled by defining the `DISABLE_RUBYGEMS`
constant in `lib/bbcloud/os_config.rb`

Ubuntu packaging scripts are available on the packaging-lucid git
branch.
